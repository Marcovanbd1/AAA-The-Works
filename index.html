<h1>Neighbourhood CoLab</h1>
<div class="tagline">Applied intelligence for real-world systems</div>

<p>
We build practical infrastructure that helps systems understand pressure earlier and respond more effectively.
</p>

<div class="section">
<h2>The problem</h2>

<p>
Many systems struggle not because people don’t care, but because they cannot reliably see what is happening in front of them.
</p>

<p>
Pressure forms quietly. Situations develop before they are visible. By the time metrics change, the problem already exists.
</p>

<p>
Most organisations are designed to react. Few are designed to notice early.
</p>
</div>


<div class="section">
<h2>The model</h2>

<p>
Neighbourhood CoLab develops decision infrastructure that strengthens how systems interpret real situations.
</p>

<p>
We design capabilities that help a place detect emerging pressure sooner, interpret what it means, support human judgement, guide clear action, and learn from real conditions.
</p>

<p>
This approach was first developed inside neighbourhood-level health infrastructure and has since proved applicable anywhere real-world judgement matters.
</p>
</div>


<div class="section">
<h2>The architecture</h2>

<p><strong>Understanding must come before response.</strong></p>

<p>We build two core capabilities that make this possible.</p>

<details>
<summary>Neighbourhood Signals — early awareness across a place</summary>

<p>
Neighbourhood Signals is a sensing and interpretation layer that allows a system to notice patterns of need before they become visible through formal demand or performance metrics.
</p>

<p>
It treats everyday activity as early signal, then turns that signal into structured insight that local leaders can interpret and act on.
</p>

<p class="small">
Tested in practice: Neighbourhood Signals has been exercised through a 91-day pilot in a live neighbourhood setting, demonstrating early detection of emerging pressure and producing locally actionable insight.
</p>

</details>


<details>
<summary>Support Playlists — clear next-step navigation</summary>

<p>
Support Playlists translate understanding into usable next steps for real people. They reduce cognitive load at the exact moment people most need clarity, after a conversation, a discharge, or a moment of uncertainty.
</p>

<p>
They link clinical, social, and practical support into a coherent path that can be followed, adapted, and shared.
</p>

</details>

<p>
Signals help systems understand.<br>
Playlists help people act.
</p>

</div>


<div class="section">
<h2>Where this works</h2>

<ul>
<li>Healthcare</li>
<li>Public services</li>
<li>Local government</li>
<li>Safety-critical sectors</li>
<li>Complex operational environments</li>
</ul>

<p>
Any setting where conditions change faster than traditional structures can interpret.
</p>

</div>


<div class="section">
<h2>Why this exists</h2>

<p>
Systems rarely fail suddenly. They fail gradually, long before anyone notices.
</p>

<p>
We build infrastructure that helps them see sooner, respond earlier, and act with confidence.
</p>

</div>


<div class="section">
<h2>How we work</h2>

<p>
Neighbourhood CoLab operates as a Community Interest Company. This keeps the work independent, practical, and structurally free from vendor or platform incentives.
</p>

<p>
Our role is not to replace existing systems. It is to strengthen their ability to function.
</p>

</div>


<div class="section">
<h2>Who we are</h2>

<p>Lucy — nurse<br>
Bruce — clinical psychologist<br>
Justin — social worker<br>
Mark — applied philosopher and systems thinker</p>

<p>
We have known each other since childhood. That shared history means we work with trust, candour, and collective judgement.
</p>
