        <h1>Neighbourhood CoLab</h1>
        <div class="subtitle">Applied intelligence for complex human systems</div>
        
        <p class="intro">Neighbourhood CoLab is a Community Interest Company that helps organisations understand and improve how they function under operational pressure.</p>
        
        <p class="intro">We work where complexity, human judgement, and safety stakes meet—in healthcare systems, aviation environments, defence operations, public services, and safety-critical organisations.</p>
        
        <p class="intro">Our method combines modern AI capability with deep frontline expertise to identify friction, strengthen decision environments, and improve how people interact with the systems they depend on.</p>
        
        <hr class="divider">
        
        <h2>What we do</h2>
        
        <p>We provide applied intelligence capability for complex operational environments.</p>
        
        <p>This means:</p>
        
        <strong>Rapid domain understanding</strong>
        <p>Learning how your organisation actually functions. Mapping workflows, pressure points, and behavioural patterns quickly.</p>
        
        <strong>Friction identification</strong>
        <p>Locating operational bottlenecks, knowledge gaps, and decision challenges that persist because institutional structures resist change.</p>
        
        <strong>Human-system redesign</strong>
        <p>Improving interaction between people and processes. Strengthening decision environments. Simplifying complexity without losing safety.</p>
        
        <strong>AI-enabled capability</strong>
        <p>Applying modern AI tools responsibly to improve knowledge capture, enhance operational understanding, and support organisational learning.</p>
        
        <strong>Cultural adoption</strong>
        <p>Ensuring improvements persist. Supporting teams to integrate new capability and change behaviour.</p>
        
        <p>The focus is operational improvement, not theoretical transformation.</p>
        
        <hr class="divider">
        
        <h2>Where we work</h2>
        
        <p>We work across sectors where complex human systems exist:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Healthcare and primary care networks</li>
            <li>Aviation training and operations</li>
            <li>Defence environments</li>
            <li>Public sector services</li>
            <li>Safety-critical organisations</li>
            <li>Complex institutional systems</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Our early work focused on neighbourhood health infrastructure. That taught us how to observe pressure, understand behaviour, remove friction, and strengthen systems.</p>
        
        <p>Healthcare provided an ideal proving ground—highly complex, safety-critical, behaviour-dependent, operationally constrained, socially embedded.</p>
        
        <p>The method we developed there generalises. Structural friction, operational pressure, knowledge bottlenecks, and institutional inertia exist everywhere. So does the need for safer, more human-centred systems.</p>
        
        <hr class="divider">
        
        <h2>Why we're structured as we are</h2>
        
        <p>Neighbourhood CoLab is deliberately a Community Interest Company.</p>
        
        <p>The CIC structure enables:</p>
        
        <strong>Agility</strong>
        <p>Lightweight engagement. Minimal procurement friction. Rapid experimentation. Faster learning cycles.</p>
        
        <strong>Independence</strong>
        <p>No vendor lock-in. No product sales incentives. No platform dependency. Neutral advisory position.</p>
        
        <strong>Public benefit orientation</strong>
        <p>Work prioritises system improvement rather than commercial extraction. Outcomes focus on people and environments.</p>
        
        <strong>Trust in sensitive contexts</strong>
        <p>The structure supports work in safety-critical or vulnerable environments where commercial incentives would create conflict.</p>
        
        <hr class="divider">
        
        <h2>Who we are</h2>
        
        <p>The organisation is grounded in deep frontline experience:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Lucy — nurse, 30 years NHS experience</li>
            <li>Bruce — clinical psychologist, 30 years NHS experience</li>
            <li>Justin — social worker, 30 years local government experience</li>
            <li>And Mark — who does something involving applied philosophy, systems thinking, and making AI work safely in human environments</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>We've all known each other since childhood. This combination ensures technology is applied responsibly, human behaviour is understood, complex social environments are navigated safely, and operational change reflects real-world practice.</p>
        
        <hr class="divider">
        
        <h2>Core principles</h2>
        
        <strong>Systems exist around people</strong>
        <p>People live in neighbourhoods. People work in organisations. People interact with institutions. Healthcare systems, aviation operations, businesses, and public services all form part of the same human system ecology. Improving how any of these systems function strengthens the broader environment in which people live.</p>
        
        <strong>Structural friction creates real-world outcomes</strong>
        <p>Most organisations contain visible operational friction that persists because institutional structures resist change, expertise becomes siloed, incentives maintain existing processes, and knowledge is difficult to transfer. We exist to help organisations identify and remove this friction.</p>
        
        <strong>Intelligence is now portable</strong>
        <p>Modern AI has changed the economics of understanding. It enables rapid domain learning, fast process analysis, knowledge capture, cross-sector translation of insight, and accelerated experimentation. This allows a consistent method to be applied across different domains.</p>
        
        <strong>Safety and human experience come first</strong>
        <p>We prioritise human wellbeing, safe interpretation of situations, responsible application of technology, understanding of vulnerability, and real-world operational risk. Technology is always subordinate to human impact.</p>
        
        <hr class="divider">
