  <h1>Thinking about neighbourhood</h1>
  <p class="intro">
    When people say they’re “thinking about neighbourhood”, they’re usually sensing the same thing.
    Places are being asked to notice pressure earlier, respond more humanly, and hold things together
    when demand or disruption hits.
  </p>
  <p class="intro">
    This page sets out a simple way to think about what a neighbourhood actually needs in order to do that well.
    Not a product. Not a platform. A small set of civic capabilities that build on each other.
  </p>
</header>

<section class="section">
  <div class="label">The anatomy</div>
  <h2>Our Digital Offer</h2>

  <p>
    A neighbourhood needs more than a single website or front door.
    It needs multiple, everyday digital surfaces that meet people where they already are and lower the effort
    needed to find support.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is about inclusion and reach, not optimisation.
    Different moments. Different levels of confidence. Different ways of arriving.
  </p>

  <div class="what-not">
    <p>
      This is not a new system, not a replacement for clinical tools,
      and not a communications exercise.
    </p>
  </div>
</section>

<section class="section">
  <div class="label">What emerges</div>
  <h2>Neighbourhood Signals</h2>

  <p>
    Once the anatomy exists, something new becomes possible.
    A neighbourhood can begin to notice patterns of pressure building early,
    across many small interactions.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is collective awareness, not individual monitoring.
    Patterns of need, not people.
  </p>

  <p>
    Neighbourhood Signals can’t be installed or owned.
    They only emerge when a place chooses to listen in the right way,
    with clear governance and restraint.
  </p>

  <div class="what-not">
    <p>
      This is not a dashboard of individuals,
      not predictive risk scoring,
      and not something any one organisation controls.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="label">The voice</div>
  <h2>Support Playlists</h2>

  <p>
    This is what people experience directly.
    When someone says what’s going on, they receive a short, safe,
    non-clinical set of approved support options.
  </p>

  <p>
    No diagnosis. No advice. No automation of judgement.
  </p>

  <p>
    Support Playlists can live inside a full neighbourhood anatomy,
    or within a credible INT-style website, as long as clear red lines are respected.
  </p>

  <div class="what-not">
    <p>
      On their own, Support Playlists are a voice,
      not neighbourhood intelligence.
    </p>
  </div>

  <p class="quiet-link">

<section class="section">
  <div class="label">A further civic capability</div>
  <h2>Neighbourhood Resilience</h2>

  <p>
    Neighbourhood resilience is about preparing a place for prolonged disruption,
    not just short incidents.
    Power outages, loss of connectivity, system failures, or sustained pressure
    that lasts days rather than hours.
  </p>

  <p>
    It asks a simple but serious question:
    what happens to this neighbourhood if normal routes stop working tomorrow?
  </p>

  <p>
    When the anatomy is in place, Signals have built awareness,
    and Support Playlists provide trusted guidance,
    a neighbourhood can maintain continuity even when digital
    or institutional systems degrade.
  </p>

  <div class="what-not">
    <p>
      This is not an emergency response or a major incident plan.
      It’s civic continuity under strain.
    </p>
  </div>
</section>

<section class="section">
  <h2>How places get there</h2>

  <p>
    There’s no rollout sequence or checklist.
    Places start by building the anatomy, agreeing the red lines,
    and growing capability in the open.
  </p>

  <p>
    Intelligence is earned over time, not switched on.
  </p>
</section>

<footer>
  <p>
    If this framing is useful, that’s the point of sharing it.
    It’s designed to help places orient themselves before jumping to solutions.
