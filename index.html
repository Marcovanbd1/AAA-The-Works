  <h1>Neighbourhood infrastructure</h1>

  <p class="intro">
    This page sets out a simple pattern of civic capabilities that neighbourhoods and Places can deliberately build.
    It’s designed for leaders responsible for neighbourhood working, Place-based partnerships, population health, and continuity.
  </p>

  <p class="intro">
    The aim is practical, not theoretical. Help a place notice pressure earlier, respond more humanly, and keep functioning when strain lasts.
    No procurement. No platform. No dependency on an external vendor. Your neighbourhood builds it with what it already has.
  </p>

  <p class="intro">
    This work is shared openly by Neighbourhood CoLab, a deliberately non-commercial, not-for-profit Community Interest Company.
    Our role is to document the pattern, define clear red lines, and support places that choose to adopt it.
  </p>

  <p class="intro">
    If you lead Place work, the question is straightforward.
    Do you want this infrastructure <strong>for</strong> your neighbourhood.
  </p>
</header>

<section class="section">
  <div class="label">The pattern</div>
  <h2>A small set of capabilities</h2>

  <p>
    Neighbourhood infrastructure works best when it’s built in layers, each one making the next possible.
    The layers are simple, but the effect is significant.
  </p>

  <div class="callout">
    <p>
      <strong>1. Anatomy</strong> creates reach and inclusion.<br />
      <strong>2. Signals</strong> creates early awareness at neighbourhood level.<br />
      <strong>3. Voice</strong> creates trusted guidance for real people.<br />
      <strong>4. Resilience</strong> creates continuity under prolonged disruption.
    </p>
  </div>
</section>

<section class="section">
  <div class="label">1. The anatomy</div>
  <h2>Our Digital Offer</h2>

  <p>
    A neighbourhood needs more than a single website or front door.
    It needs a coherent set of everyday digital surfaces that meet people where they already are and reduce the effort needed to find support.
  </p>

  <p>
    In practice, this usually means a stable neighbourhood website acting as a civic reference point,
    plus lightweight entry routes that can be shared quickly in normal life,
    plus consistent language and structure across partners so people don’t have to relearn the system each time.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is about reach, legibility, and inclusion.
    It sits alongside clinical systems and institutional tools, helping people arrive earlier and through calmer, non-clinical routes.
  </p>

  <div class="callout">
    <p>
      The anatomy is a local choice.
      It belongs to the neighbourhood, it’s stewarded in the open, and it improves with use.
    </p>
  </div>
</section>

<section class="section">
  <div class="label">2. What emerges</div>
  <h2>Neighbourhood Signals</h2>

  <p>
    Once the anatomy exists, a place can begin to notice patterns of pressure building early across many small interactions.
    This is neighbourhood-level awareness, earned over time.
  </p>

  <p>
    Signals are about <strong>patterns</strong>, not people.
    They help leaders and teams spot where confusion, friction, and unmet need are rising, before that pressure hardens into demand.
  </p>

  <p>
    Neighbourhood Signals are not installed, purchased, or owned.
    They emerge when a place chooses to listen with restraint and with explicit governance about what is seen, shared, and acted upon.
  </p>

  <div class="callout">
    <p>
      The leadership value is simple.
      You get lived operational relief, not data theatre.

<section class="section">
  <div class="label">3. The voice</div>
  <h2>Support Playlists</h2>

  <p>
    Support Playlists are what people experience directly.
    Someone says what’s going on, in their own words, and receives a short, safe, non-clinical set of approved support options.
  </p>

  <p>
    The point is guidance without judgement.
    A next step that’s realistic, local where possible, and easy to share.
  </p>

  <p>
    Support Playlists can sit inside a full neighbourhood anatomy, or within a credible INT-style website,
    as long as clear red lines are respected.
  </p>

  <div class="callout">
    <p>
      Support Playlists are a voice.
      On their own they are not neighbourhood intelligence, and they do not replace clinical care.
    </p>
  </div>

<section class="section">
  <div class="label">4. A further civic capability</div>
  <h2>Neighbourhood Resilience</h2>

  <p>
    Neighbourhood resilience is about prolonged disruption, when strain lasts and normal routes stop working as expected.
    Power loss. Connectivity failure. Workforce depletion. System outages. Sustained pressure over days or weeks.
  </p>

  <p>
    It asks a simple, unavoidable question.
    <strong>What continues to function in this neighbourhood if normal routes degrade tomorrow.</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    When a neighbourhood has a shared anatomy, earned awareness through Signals, and trusted guidance via Support Playlists,
    it can maintain continuity even when digital or institutional conditions are no longer ideal.
  </p>

  <div class="callout">
    <p>
      This is civic continuity under strain.
      It’s a responsible leadership capability, not an innovation project.
    </p>
  </div>
</section>

<section class="section">
  <div class="label">Adoption</div>
  <h2>How places get there</h2>

  <p>
    There’s no rollout sequence or checklist.
    Places usually begin by building the anatomy, agreeing explicit red lines, and growing capability in the open.
  </p>

  <p>
    The point is to build this internally.
    Neighbourhood CoLab can share patterns, templates, and hard-earned lessons from a place that’s already done it,
    so you can move faster without losing trust.
  </p>

  <div class="callout">
    <p>
      If you’re leading Place work and you want this infrastructure for your neighbourhood,
      get in touch and we’ll share what’s transferable, what isn’t, and what good stewardship looks like from day one.
    </p>
  </div>
